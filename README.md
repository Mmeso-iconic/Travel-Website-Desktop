# Travel – Explore the World

This is a simple and responsive travel-themed website that showcases beautiful destinations, services, and reasons why you should travel with us. It includes clean visuals, a video section, and a mobile-friendly layout. This is my first web project, and it was built using only HTML and CSS to practice layout design and styling.
